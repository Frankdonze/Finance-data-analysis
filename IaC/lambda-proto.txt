These things need to be coded after prototyping:

S3 bucket for file transfer done

IAM
- create role
- create policy for s3 

lambda funtion
- lambda layer using zip file
- IAM permissions to write to S3
	- role needs to be written and referenced in lambda resource
	- need to create policy to strictly allow writing objects to s3 or could grant full access.
- enviornment variable in the function

eventbright
- code it
